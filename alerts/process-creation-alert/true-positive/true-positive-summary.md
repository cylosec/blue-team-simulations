## Summary

A suspicious process execution alert was triggered by Sysmon Event ID 1, where `cscript.exe` was used to run `winrm.vbs` with elevated privileges. Initial review suggested a benign configuration task; however, further investigation revealed follow-up indicators of **unauthorized remote access and lateral movement**.

## Timeline & Escalation Evidence

| Time | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 03:30:55 | Sysmon Event ID 1 | Execution of `cscript winrm.vbs` |
| 03:30:58 | Sysmon Event ID 3 | Network connection to 10.0.0.25:5985 |
| 03:31:02 | Windows Event ID 4624 | Successful remote interactive logon |
| 03:31:05 | Sysmon Event ID 1 | Execution of encoded PowerShell on remote host |
| 03:31:10 | Windows Event ID 7045 | New service `winmgmtsvc` installed remotely |

## Analyst Determination

This behavior is consistent with adversary techniques used post-compromise:
- Changing WinRM client settings to enable Basic authentication (or disable negotiation/encryption)
- Connecting via WinRM to another internal system (port 5985)
- Using valid credentials to pivot or drop a malicious service
- Establishing remote command execution via PowerShell or service abuse

## Incident Status

**True Positive ‚Äì Confirmed Lateral Movement via WinRM**

## üìÅ Remediation & Recommendations

- [x] Disable WinRM on affected endpoints unless required  
- [x] Audit WinRM listener and client config (GPO + Registry)  
- [x] Rotate credentials for CYLOSEC\Administrator  
- [x] Search for matching hashes or command-line patterns across all endpoints  
- [x] Investigate all Event ID 4624 entries with Logon Type 3 or 10  
- [x] Document incident in SOC escalation log and submit to GRC review if required
