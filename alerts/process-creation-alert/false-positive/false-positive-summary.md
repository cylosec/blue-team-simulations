# False Positive Summary Report â€“ Process Creation Alert

## Alert Summary

- **Alert Type:** Process Creation (Sysmon Event ID 1)
- **Detection Source:** Wazuh SIEM
- **Rule Triggered:** Suspicious Windows cmd shell execution
- **Host:** WIN-1T5RE39Q2K5
- **User:** CYLOSEC\Administrator
- **Executable:** cscript.exe
- **Command Line:** `cscript //nologo "C:\Windows\System32\winrm.vbs" set winrm/config/client/auth ...`
- **Timestamp:** 2025-07-10 03:30:55 UTC
- **Alert ID:** 1752118315.6279996

## Triage Overview

Initial analysis indicated execution of `cscript.exe` to modify WinRM client authentication settings using `winrm.vbs`. This behavior commonly appears in both administrative configurations and lateral movement setups. 

The process was launched under a high-integrity session belonging to `CYLOSEC\Administrator`.

## Key Indicators Reviewed

| Indicator | Observation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Executing User | Domain Admin account (lab-controlled) |
| Parent Process | `cmd.exe` |
| Network Activity | None detected (no Event ID 3) |
| Frequency | Triggered 8 times (repeatable script) |
| Follow-up Activity | No Event IDs 4624, 7045, or lateral connections |

## Determination

Based on context and lack of malicious follow-up behavior, this activity is determined to be a **false positive**. The command aligns with expected administrative activity within a controlled lab environment.

## Action Taken

- Alert documented and marked as reviewed
- Added classification note for `cscript.exe` + `winrm.vbs` behavior under known admin actions
- No immediate tuning implemented to retain visibility for future correlation
- Detection rule updated to allow severity downgrade when executed by known users

## Recommendation

If this behavior is recurring and verified as safe across systems, consider one of the following:
- Implement allowlist based on exact command line + user context
- Lower severity to reduce alert fatigue
- Add annotation to detection logic for internal documentation
